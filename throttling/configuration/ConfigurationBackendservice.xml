	 | Specifying a backend system and configuring it.
	 |
	 | Element name: backendService
	 |
	 | More backendService elements can be specified as a list.
	 |
	 | Attributes:
	 |   name: the name of the backend service; mandatory: YES
	 |   maxLoading: the number of requests which can be served without applying a feature; mandatory: YES
	 |   averageResponseTime: the value of the average response time in milliseconds; if a request exceeds (e.g. while waiting) this value a fault 
	 |                        should be thrown; mandatory: YES
	 |
 	 | Child elements: 
	 || - feature: the feature can be defined here which will be assigned to the backend service
	 ||     Attributes:
	 ||       name: the name of the feature; mandatory: YES
	 ||
	 ||     Element name: feature
	 ||
	 ||     Child elements: some parameters can be defined for the new feature which can be done by the element 'param'; detailed descript see below
	 ||     Mandatory: NO
	 ||     More parameters can be specified as a list.
	 ||     Attributes of the element 'param':
	 ||       name: name of the parameter; mandatory: YES
	 ||     Value: the value of the parameter
	 |
	 || - simulatedService: it is possible to define exceptions which are valid only for the specific simulated service (all the simulated services will use the 
	 ||                     feature being set on the backendService level except this simulated service)
	 ||     Attributes:
	 ||       name: the name of the simulated service; mandatory: YES
	 ||
	 ||     Element name: simulatedService
	 ||
	 ||     More simulatedService elements can be specified as a list.
     ||
	 ||     Child elements: one feature can be defined for the simulated service; description: see above
	 |
	 | Parameters:
	 |   1. WaitingFeature
	 |       - period: the period of the sleeping in millisec. (it is used in WaitingFeature)
	 |       - waitingReqListMaxSize: If the requests has to be registered individually (strategy=REGISTERING_REQUESTS_INDIVIDUALLY) then the id of the request must be 
	 |             stored in list. Handling a huge list would be very time and performance consuming so this list is split smaller lists and the max. size these smaller 
     |             list can be controlled with the this parameter
	 |       - maxNumberOfWaitingReqs: If the requests has to be registered individually (strategy=REGISTERING_REQUESTS_INDIVIDUALLY) then the id of the request must be 
	 |             stored in list. The max. number of the requests can be set here.
	 |       - strategy: What strategy is used when waiting is needed? Possible values: FAST, MAINTAINING_FREE_SLOTS, REGISTERING_REQUESTS_INDIVIDUALLY
	 |   1. SendBackFaultFeature: no parameters
